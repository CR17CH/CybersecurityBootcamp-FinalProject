# CybersecurityBootcamp-Project-1-Work
This folder encompasses all work which has been completed in a cybersecurity bootcamp. 

This will house the following folders: 

# Ansible

These are YAML scripts which were created for docker. This has linked multiple Web Virtual Machines together for the capabiltity of being attacked/exploited. 

# Network Diagrams

The network Diagrams show different attacks made as well as network infrastructure/design. 

# Linux Bash Code

Linux bash code is a demonstration of the capability of my work within the linux console, creation/running of scripts. 

These have been completed within the duration of the completion of a bootcamp.
